        <p>Another fun-filled and exhausting week at Landry Academy’s Game Programming Camp 2012. We had five students, ages 15 and 16, many of whom had never touched a compiler before this class.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Camp2012/students.jpg" alt="The Students"></p>

<p>On the first day, we spent several hours installing the tools that we needed to create games (Visual Studio 2010 Express and XNA). We had a brainstorming session while we waited for the installers to do their magic, planning what type of game we would build. I was campaigning for a Rock Band / Guitar Hero style game, but the class decided to design a platformer game (ala Super Mario Bros.).</p>

<p>A cartoony hero walks around a factory / lab complex jumping on the heads of killer robots to destroy them. There are two flavors of robot: the Hoverbot who quickly floats towards the player, and the Tankbot who moves a little slower, but fires missiles at the player at regular intervals. When a robot is destroyed, it drops a gear (likely) or a heart (less frequently). The player’s score is the number of gears collected.</p>

<p>The game’s art is a collection of doodles that I did in Adobe Illustrator, feverishly churning out assets each evening in an attempt to stay a step ahead of the class. The main character is the result of a tutorial that I followed over at <a href="http://www.idleworm.com/how/anm/02w/walk1.shtml">idleworm.com</a>.</p>

<p>Along the way, the students learned about how simple, manageable components of a game are implemented, and how those simpler parts combine to make a more-complex whole. They also learned about the tools that game developers use to create games, and how to trim and prioritize an overly ambitious design to meet a looming deadline.</p>

<p>The plan to make a platformer turned out to be too much work for a week-long project. We cut features, and ultimately decided to turn the project into a survival game.</p>

<p>This was my second time teaching a class of high-schoolers. I thoroughly enjoyed my week at camp, and the students seemed to as well.</p>
